# Spell Check

A simple app for a spell checker for android.

### Description

I originally built this project to pass off the requirements for a class assignment. It suggests words for inputs not included in it's dictionary. It uses a 'trie' data structure.

### Explanatory Note

I created this project before I learned better practices. As such, it's not my best work, but it does help demonstrate the creativity I had even when I was learning.

### Instructions

A test driver is supplied. This tests the code to verify that it passes the requirements for the given assignment.
